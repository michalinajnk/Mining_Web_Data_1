Had been patronising more than 10 years ago since they were at POMO and this is the Fish n Chips that's changed my perspective of the dish (even better than Bread Street's imo). Still so good after so many years. The balance of the thin crispy batter and thickness of the fish is perfect. For 7.90 you get 1 fish and 2 sides. Be sure to drizzle malt vinegar before every bite! High recommend the Dory Fish n Chips.\n",

Today I just ate late lunch: flatwhite and chicken katsu sandwich and was asked by a very nice lady staff \"how was my coffee and sandwich\". I've felt I didn't gave her enough feedbacks, so I have decided to write a review instead. We actually love the coffee shop very much, that is why we often visit this place, rather than other commercialized coffee shops nearby. The ambience is cozy, clean, the staffs are all nice and most importantly, the food and drinks are served and in good quality. As mentioned to the lady, I only wished they have a larger cup size of the drinks. But overall the place is really goood and instagramable 😊☕️✨\n",

            "  Review Text: 3.5 stars. Clean and spacious restaurant with simple set up. Ordered chicken chop on hot plate with black pepper sauce, curry chicken with prata and lime juice (forgot to take picture). The dishes were average, not bad. The chicken chop was tender, fries were thick and chunky, the vegetables (carrot and broccoli) were fresh. The serving for the curry was not generous, there was only one small piece of chicken in the curry and a few pieces of potato. The taste is nice, similar to home cooked curry. They have another type of curry on the menu, claypot curry with bread or rice, that is a thicker version of curry. The prata is crispy and tasted nice with the curry. Lime juice has sour plum taste, quite refreshing. The restaurant serves dim sum and many other items such as spring chicken, fried rice, spaghetti, and cheese fries etc., I may return to try other dishes. Service was alright, the staff was quite friendly and efficient.\n",

Being an extension of ASTONS Specialties, it prides itself on offering a menu crafted from high-quality, fresh ingredients. While the restaurant has garnered a mix of positive and negative feedback, with some patrons lauding the value-for-money offerings, others have differing opinions. With an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars on platforms like Tripadvisor from 44 reviews, the restaurant presents varying experiences to its customers.\n",

            "During my visit, I encountered issues with the service staff's slow efficiency and forgetfulness of orders, leading to repeated requests. To enhance the dining experience, I suggest implementing QR code ordering, a popular trend in many restaurants today. Additionally, there was a mix-up with my side dish, resulting in the wrong item being served initially. However, upon notifying the staff, they promptly rectified the mistake by providing the correct side dish in a separate bowl. Despite these hiccups, the food maintained its delicious taste and remained value for money.\n",

Their noodles tasted like bee hoon, those thick types. Ordered one of their signature, 过桥面. It was a hearty bowl of noodles. Shared it with my missus as I don’t think one can finish the entire bowl easily. The ingredient was fresh and generous. Filled with pork belly, beef, chicken and lots of other ingredients as well. Broth was flavourful. Personally not a bee hoon person so didn’t really like the noodles (personal taste). But the rest was really good. One highlight, I thought that the restaurant was rather noisy when people started pulling their chairs. Other than that, good meal.\n",

The texture of chicken feet is normal but I dun know why it tastes sour, maybe they added too much vinegar. The char siew is the worst one I have ever tried, as u can see the color is totally different from what I expected. It looks like braised pork instead of roasted n no flavor at all.\n",

In all fairness, they do seem to re-fry their chickens upon order sometimes but that's no issue to me - it's tasty, hot and still pretty good. Low reviews here are totally unjustified to me - this is a kopitiam and the price point is at $5-6. Please take your complaints to cafes/ establishments that charge close to $30 for similar fare.

It was frustrating because why display the food if she wasn't going to sell it and then proceed to sell it to someone else? It should be a simple process, but she made it unnecessarily complicated. People go there to buy food, not to get it for free, so it was disappointing to receive such poor service.

The Italian-Japanese food joint is a common sight in Japan which offers no frills fast and value food options. The concept is similar. The food is not fantastic but it is very acceptable. Not much services as most things are self service. The kids love the pizza here as they are thin crusts.\n",

            "  Review Text: The food is of good quality, especially known for their steaks and spread of different combinations. I got the sirlion steak (medium rare) that comes with a potato stuffed with sour cream, green onions, and bacon bits, as well as some cauliflower and carrots. This was quite tasty as the meat was very soft and tender, although it could use some salt in my opinion. The potato was the best part as it was soft and paired soo well with the sauce and toppings, loved it. I also ordered the lamb shank, that came with the same sides. I liked this dish more as it was very delicious, soft, and flavourful. Both meats had quite an  amount of hard fat at the side of the meat which made it slightly hard to eat. Other than that the lamb has soft and tasty fat in the meat. Lastly, I got apple pie for dessert that came with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce and nuts on top. It was pretty good, although I have definitely had better. Would recommend the ice cream more. The staff seemed very busy and rarely came to our table to clear the unwanted plates when dessert came. It was hard to get their attention and it seems slightly chaotic.\n",

Damn amazed on this food, didnt expect to be one of the best tze char eaten so far. The fried rice has the right amount of wok hey and yangzhou fragrance. Sambal kangkong is unique, the sambal isnt those normal sambal u easily can get off the shelf in supermarkets. Even the sweet and sour pork doneness was well cooked, not hard nor over soft, just the right doneness. And the portion is surprisingly bigger then most places, bought medium fried rice, small kangkong and pork.\n",

            "  Review Text: Poorly executed food in the name of Ipoh delicacies. Overall the price are expensive starts from $8++ for Big, which looks like regular portion at other eateries. The cashier keyed in Big portion (without asking us) for all noodles we ordered. When checked with cashier on the price billed,  we were told that the size for Small is ' very small'. Well, just not really happy with that answer. My expectation for Ipoh curry mee was high until I tried it, totally disappointed. Lacking of flavours, even cai png stall serves better curry. Not to mention the hard char siew. Followed by another letdown which is the shredded chicken Ipoh hor fun. No taste of chicken flavour in the soup, felt like drinking syrup water only. Never want to continue eating. Dried handmade noodle was full of oil,  too much lard /oil until very jelak, not to my liking. Prawn noodle soup was also nothing better, never want to finish the food too. The free fried fritter was a bit oily to me. I think this will be our first as well as last visit to this eatery. The Malaysia Boleh which is only few steps away, serve much better food at more reasonable price.\n",

The only thing I like was the fermented pork belly (if u really must come, it’s ok to order this). And on to the star of the show - braise platter. The underlying sauce is way too sweet, the stomach and intestines overcooked and tough. And what shocked me after double checking it was missing 2 chicken wings! After highlighting to the manager, it was replaced after 10+mins and not to my surprise, it has completely no taste and was totally cold once you bite into it. I’m really shocked that such standards can still open a restaurant. I really wish them best of luck and hopefully to be more serious in what they serve to their customers.\n",

            "  Review Text: Have been eating here since the day they opened, although they have downsized and the menu changed significantly. Decided not to try the usual dishes but chose 3 special dishes from the “Parent’s day” special menu. 1. The soup which was a thick broth similar to fish maw soup but has more ginger and vinegar added. 2. Shredded cabbage with a special mala tongue numbing dressing (something like the Japanese shredded cabbage in tonkatsu restaurants) 3. Mochi with yam paste (dessert). 1 & 2 were delicious but 3 could be softer in texture and the yam fillings slightly sweeter. We also ordered the sweet and sour fish from the main menu. For me, the sauce was done too sweet and too sour. The fish slices was deep fried, done crispy outside soft inside.  A special mention could be made for their 8 Treasure tea. Chock full of the “treasures”, it was one of the better version amongst the Chinese restaurants.\n",

Other than delicious, the smaller portion allows us to try more dishes. The white cabbage dumpling was overly salty. We feedback to staff who took it earnestly and volunteer a change. Will love to be back again. Staff service is very attentive and good.\n",

            "Older review: Food is good, the preparation speed is amazing, despite visiting on a Sunday night, the waiting time is close to negligible. The fish head steamboat is the probably one of the best I’ve had for awhile, first is firm and fresh, big cuts of it, soup is fantastic rich and aromatic, made with herbs in it. The claypot liver is fantastic as well, I really don’t usually give 5 star reviews but this is perfectly season, cook to perfection as well, one thing to note is that, when the livers are served, it is serve on a claypot which continuous to cook, the cook was perfect when it was served to us, but if you leave it inside the claypot, they may get a little overcook after awhile so I suggest you either remove it from the claypot or finish it quickly. Prawn paste chicken is fried perfectly, oil is fresh, chicken is fresh, sweet and sour pork is good as well, I do wish the fried on it was a little more crispy, the mushroom and vege is nicely cooked and season as well, 100% will visit again, the only thing I can pick on is the air ventilation of the entire coffee shop, and as rather stuffy in there.\n",

While both dishes were delicious, my colleague felt a bit disappointed that the mentaiko salmon fried rice didn't live up to its name in terms of the egg content.

Chicken was so-so nothing mind blowing, sauce was OK I guess, chilli was average too.

            "  Review Text: Very delicious chicken dishes here, ranging from different types of noodles to having it in white rice. The chicken in every dish is so soft, moist, and very well seasoned. The skin is soo soft and soaks up all the tasty and savoury sauce, while the tender and soft chicken neatly tears apart so easily. I got the chicken leg with rice and the boneless chicken mee Kia with spring onion sauce. It’s both soo tasty, and i would say that the noodles had more distinct flavour. But the chicken with rice is a classic must-have! One important detail is the amazing savoury and spicy chili sauce that leans towards the sour side. It all pairs perfectly with each other and each dish has a bowl of soup to wash it all down. Highly recommend trying the food here for a very affordable price!\n",

The noodle portion is quite substantial. It consists of 1 fried fish ball which is not oily, very good. Another one is the pork ball which I’m not a fan of. Also has slices of pork, well done 👍. Minced pork, a leaf of lettuce & pork lard. Surprisingly the pork lard does not make the noodle oily, another plus point. The soup has no fish taste, I’m not sure how the soup is cooked but it’s very 甘甜. 🫡 Overall, I feel that the noodle is cooked with love & passion.\n",

First impression when the dishes arrived was normal but the food taste above average for a vegetarian place. The taste are on point and more towards heavy tastebuds. As for the bittergound with Tofu set, the only downside is the bittergound given was rather lesser than expected but they make up in giving you more tofu. There are many items on the menu which make it a great place for gathering as it have dishes that can cater to any one taste bud. Do note that when the place get packed, the place may be very noisy.

Moreover, it cost $27 per plate which is the same price as 排骨王。 Overall the food considered nice, environment is quiet, chilli that served was a bit salty, sheltered car park cost $2.40 per hour, waitress keep helping us to refill the tea, is a recommended place for department lunch.\n",

Ordered the We Meat again combo and as seen in my photo, the chicken portion is pathetic. You'd expect a normal portion of steak AND normal portion of chicken as shown in the menu but no, the chicken is smaller than half a piece of usual chicken size. Not worth the price at all!\n",

The other male waiter (who seemed to be the manager) we interacted with was really rude and impatient (the restaurant was not busy) when we were ordering our icecream. There was also a mix up with orders a few times, and we had food/drinks sent to our table by mistake. Other than that, service was pretty quick in terms of us getting our orders.\n",

We decided to go for the weekday lunch set which comes with free flow of miso soup and hot tea. I’m surprise they serve the whole flask of hot tea so we don’t need to get it refilled at the counter all the time. Food was serve quickly. Portion was fairly huge. Definitely value for money. The dory fish is fresh and crispy, but I personally feel the teriyaki sauce is a bit on the sweet side, it can be easily overcome by adding some chili powder. Service is ok. There is only 1 service stuff which is understandable consider the weak lunch crowd. Would recommend if you are nearby and looking for Japanese food.\n",

            "  Review Text: I was very disappointed with my dining experience today. Firstly, my wife and I ordered 2 monday promotion ribeye steaks with add-on value set, but we were surprised that only served with one bread. When I asked the staff about it, they mentioned that only à la carte orders come with bread or if we had ordered a main course. This was confusing for us as we both ordered the same promotion set with additional value sets for two people, yet we were only given one bread to share. It was a bit disappointing. Secondly, my wife's steak was cooked well done instead of medium, although she mentioned she was okay with it. We didn't bring this up to the staff. Thirdly, the staff seemed less attentive, perhaps because it was a Monday with fewer customers. They even forgot my ice cream, and when it was finally served, the inside was icy rather than creamy as shown in the photo. I have visited the JEM and Jurong Safra outlets before, and their standards were excellent. I don't plan on returning to this outlet as I felt like I wasted my money and the service was subpar. Despite only a few tables being occupied, the staff seemed disorganized, and I had to get my own extra plate and condiments sauce. Overalls experience not very present.\n",

And mind you, it’s 15th Nov 2023, the last day of AIA vouchers redemption. I’m surprised how fast the service was in this branch. By 7.58pm, our meals are served. Consider waiting for the table, ordering and food preparation. That’s fast even it’s short handed. The assistant manager lady didn’t even stop to rest. She’s manning the cashier, placing take away orders, serving, attending to customers, check orders, follow up after main course to ensure desserts are served immediately, packing cakes and take away, etc. She never stop for a break. And thus the table turn over rate is faster which allows diners to get their seats faster, eat, and leave. Very efficient lady I must say. Sorry I didn’t get your name.\n",

Overall impression was the noodles portion was adequate, soup was not too rich and well-flavoured. Gyoza were crispy and not oily, fillings were juicy and not dry. However, the chasu texture was a bit hard and it was the only item that didn’t make it a five-star meal (美中不足). Hot green tea was refillable and the aircon is cool enough. Self-ordering was easy and payment can be made by Visa/mastercard/NETS. No service charge and GST.

            "I often visit amk hub's Thai express with my husband during lunch or dinner as we live nearby. We were visiting the outlet for lunch today and got attended to by a young lady at the counter. She greeted us and then proceeded to print out the QR code ticket for ordering, aftering passing the ticket to us we tried reaching out to her on a question we have as she was the only service staff available as the other auntie was having her lunch at the back however was ignored and the young lady went to the counter and continued staring at her laptop. If she was far away when we reached out to her I would understand that she might not have heard us calling however we reached out to her just as she turned around therefore it was impossible not to have heard us. The auntie at the back who was having her lunch saw the situation and rushed to finish off her meal and came over to asked us on what we needed and assisted us with a smile before she continued with her lunch break. After placing our orders we were waiting for our dishes and drinks to arrive, the young lady was again the one serving the dishes as the auntie staff was on her lunch break and what shocked us the most is that for every single dish that she served up even before completely placing the dish on the table she turns around and walk away. We were not expecting a great service attitude across all staffs however basic manners should still be upholded if one is working in the service industry. My husband even thanked her everytime she delivered the dishes to us but was only met with slience from her end. I am not sure if the young lady is a manager for the outlet at amk hub but I am sure hoping that she isnt. We would normally understand that sometimes people can be having a bad day however for her this is not the case as every single time we visited the outlet we were met with the same attitude and unpleasant experience from her end. The auntie (Carol) on the other hand is fantastic, always greeting us warming and assisting us with our dining needs everytime we patronise the restuarant. Thank you Carol for being such an outstanding service person with a bright and positive attitude and as for the other young lady staff I hope that something can be done to correct her behavior as it is sad to see a restuarant that we enjoy dining in have staff that are lacking basic service manners.\n",

We were allocated seats inside the restaurant but the intoxicating smell of mala filled the air and we were not comfortable and asked for a change to the outdoor seats. Food items were fresh and the spiciness of the hotpot can be determined since the paste was given to us. I found the ingredients fresh but lacking service. It might be due to the fact that we were seated outside so not much attention from them. Good wise I thought they were ok but not great.\n",

For the chicken katsu curry, the chicken katsu is pretty average, with a decent japanese curry sauce. Nothing mind-blowing. Worth it with the burpple 1-for-1 but not worth without it.

I have been buying daily bowl regularly from many other branches when I feel like eating salad kind of meal.  I was shocked to see how little the portion that was given.  I asked for lettuce, cucumber and tomato only as the base and had real hard time digging for the lettuce and after numerous tough tries then managed to dig out the 4 small pathetic slices of cucumber, 4 slices that were lumped with the smoked salmon giving me the illusion that they  are generous with the mains ended up eating tomatoes actually.  Had 2 portions of potato salad and not sure why it came with pickles which I did not orders. The price has gone up to $9.40 and yet they reduced the quantity.  Din know inflation at Clementi can cause the lettuce, cucumber to be of such high cost now.  First time I can finish one full bowl by myself and not feeling full.  Time to source for alternatives as this is really not affordable now.  Should have monitored the weight during payment as 100% sure I was being short changed.\n",

The Creamy Chicken Spaghetti was really good though. We enjoyed the Iced Lemon Tea and Flat White. While the service was generally friendly and efficient, we did find it a bit difficult to get the staff's attention at times.  This might be due to the fact that orders are placed via QR code, so the staff may be more focused on serving the food.  The ambience of the cafe was also quite pleasant.

Situated at the industrial building and the this restaurant is the anchor stall at the coffee shop. Business was brisk on a weekend night and there are ample parking lots available. Most of the tables ordered crabs so I believe their crabs are also very popular. We didn’t order crabs as it’s quite a hassle to eat it. Pricing is a little steep as the restaurant is not air conditioned and in a shopping mall. The only consolation is that the final bill doesn’t charge any service charge. Will still recommend for the food is good and tasty.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Limited Number of Reviews:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Google Places API only allows you to retrieve up to 5 reviews per place, even if there are many more reviews available on Google Maps. This can be a significant limitation if you're trying to gather comprehensive feedback on a location, as you'll miss out on a large portion of the user opinions that could provide valuable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Only Recent Reviews, No Historical Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another limitation is that the API only provides the most recent reviews. If you're interested in seeing how the perception of a place has changed over time or if you want to analyze older reviews, the API won't be helpful. It doesn’t offer access to a place's full review history, so you’re stuck with just the latest few opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Avoiding the Limitation**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Web Scraping (With Caution):**\n",
        "\n",
        "To get around the limitation of only retrieving 5 reviews, one alternative is web scraping, which involves programmatically extracting data directly from the Google Maps website instead of using the API. This method could allow you to access all available reviews, not just the most recent five.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's important to note that web scraping is not officially supported by Google and can be against their terms of service. This means that if Google detects that you are scraping their site, they could block your IP address, or worse, take legal action. Additionally, scraping often involves complex code and can be affected by changes in the website’s structure. Because of these risks, it's essential to consider the ethical and legal implications carefully before deciding to use web scraping. For academic purposes or legitimate data analysis, it’s better to explore other methods or to seek permission from Google.\n",
